## Architecture decisions records

We use [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) to document the architectural decisions made on this project.

You can find the ADRs in the [architecture/decisions](architecture/decisions) directory.

### Create a new ADR

Please make sure you have installed [`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) before creating a new ADR.

To create a new ADR, run the following command:

```bash
adr new Name of the architecture decision
```

That will create a new ADR as a markdown file in the `architecture/decisions` directory following the order of the last ADR created.

## Monorepo

For monorepo tooling, please read the documentation [here](./monorepo.md)
